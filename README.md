# Code/scripts I wrote to solve CTF challenges

#### Python scripting for cybersecurity
* [Mathy](ctf-challenges/IS590R-challenges/hard/README.md) - Socket programming with Netcat to perform simple addition, designed to teach basic Python skills as well as the Socket and/or pwn libraries.
* [GrePy](ctf-challenges/IS590R-challenges/easy/README.md) - Simple Python and or grep commands to find the flag in a dynamically created folder full of random words in .txt files.
* [World Wide Web](ctf-challenges/IS590R-challenges/medium/README.md) - Using requests and BeautifulSoup libraries in Python for web scraping and automation to find hrefs in a large page and follow a chain of links towards a final flag. Simpler version of the challenge I saw in CSAW Qualifiers in 2022 that I solved with [www.py](ctf-code/www.py)
